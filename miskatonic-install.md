# FreeBSD 12.1 installation notes

## fileserver / light compute - miskatonic

Screen by screen:

### Keymap selection

Standard US keyboard map (default)

### Hostname

miskatonic, because I'm a dork like that. I trust I'll be able to add a domain
name at some point later without misery; if there is misery involved I guess I
just repave.

oh no, the doc I didn't read until after I went through asks for a FQDN. welp.

### Distribution select

neat, this doesn't match the online doc. well, I hit enter rather than space so
I'm left with the default, that's probably for the best.
